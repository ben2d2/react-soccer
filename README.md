This application is built using ReactJS, Backbone, and jQuery with the intent to serve the families of 936 children in a soccer league. THe original schedule was sent via email in a PDF that was a collection of scanned images. This was hard to parse and after week two we had players missing games because of a difficult to read PDF schedule. Needing an excuse to play with a new library, I picked up ReactJS from a co-worker and started building. This is a second iteration and a much cleaner, simpler implementation.

#### Thanks to @nicinabox for the demo
